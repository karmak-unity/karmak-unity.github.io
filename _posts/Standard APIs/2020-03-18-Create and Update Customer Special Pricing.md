```

## Update
### PUT
```
https://api.karmak.io/api/unity/{version}/unityapi/CustomerSpecialPricing/Update
````

## BUSINESS RULES
---

Customer Special Pricing records created via an API **must** define a Pricing Target and a Pricing Strategy.

-   Only one Pricing Target can be passed in the request.
-   Only one Pricing Strategy can be passed in the request.
-   Both a Pricing Target and a Pricing Strategy must be passed.

### Pricing Target 
The target to which the record will apply, either a Customer Price Type, or Customer.


#### Customer Price Type

To create or update a customer special pricing record by Customer Price Type:
-   Pass in the Customer Price Type to which the record applies
    -   A list of valid Customer Price Types can be obtained using the Quick List data access API

#### Customer
To create or update a customer special pricing record by Customer:
-   Pass in the Customer Key and Customer base branch code to which the record applies
    -   A valid list of customers can be obtained using the Customer data access API



---


### Pricing Strategy
The type of pricing for which the record is created (Cost Matrix, Velocity, Part Criteria)



#### Cost Matrix
To create or update a customer special pricing record for Cost Matrix Code:
-   Pass in the Cost Matrix Code to which the record applies.
    -   A list of valid Cost Matrix Codes can be obtained using the Quick List data access API.


#### Velocity
To create or update a customer special pricing record by Velocity Type Code:
-   Pass in the Velocity Code Type to which the record applies.
    -   A valid list of Velocity Type Codes can be obtained using the VelocityCodeTypes data access API.
	

#### Part Criteria
To create or update a customer special pricing record by Price Data:
-   There are multiple pricing paths in the part criteria strategy.
	- Note: in order to create or update Part Number pricing, you must also pass a price level or a Contract Price

## Request Samples
--------------------

If you call the POST method, an existing record is NOT overridden, if you call PUT method then override occurs

The general structure of the payload is as follows FOR CREATE:
```json
[
    {
        "ExpirationDate": "04/30/2020",
        "PricingTarget": {  },
        "PricingStrategy": {  },
        "InternalNote": "This is my note."
    }
]
```

The general structure of the payload is as follows FOR UPDATE:
```json
[
	{
        "ID" : 100256,
        "ExpirationDate": "04/30/2020",
        "PricingTarget": {  },
        "PricingStrategy": {  },
        "InternalNote": "This is my note."
    }
]
```

First determine what type of Pricing Target you are going to use, either Customer or Customer Price Type.


**Pricing Target is Customer, Pricing Strategy is Velocity Code example:**

```json
[
    {
        "ExpirationDate": "04/30/2020",
        "PricingTarget": {
            "CustomerKey": "12345",
            "CustomerBaseBranchCode": "15"
        },
        "PricingStrategy": {
            "VelocityCode": "01adb"
        },
        "InternalNote": "This is my note."
    }
]
```

**To UPDATE the above record will appear as follows:**

```json
[
    {
		"ID": 100256,
        "ExpirationDate": "04/30/2020",
        "PricingTarget": {
            "CustomerKey": "12345",
            "CustomerBaseBranchCode": "15"
        },
        "PricingStrategy": {
            "VelocityCode": "01adb"
        },
        "InternalNote": "This is my note."
    }
]
```



**Pricing Target is Customer Price Type, Pricing Strategy is Velocity Code example:**

```json
[
    {
        "ExpirationDate": "04/30/2020",
        "PricingTarget": {
            "CustomerPriceType": "234abc"
        },
        "PricingStrategy": {
            "VelocityCode": "01adb"
        },
        "InternalNote": "This is my note."
    }
]
```



**Pricing Target is Customer, Pricing Strategy is Cost Matrix Code:**

```json

            "CostMatrixCode": "25abc"
        },
