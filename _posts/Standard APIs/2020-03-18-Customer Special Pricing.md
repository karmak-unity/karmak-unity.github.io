## Request Samples
--------------------

If you call the POST method, an existing record is NOT overridden, if you call PUT method then override occurs

The general structure of the payload is as follows:
```json
[
    {
        "ExpirationDate": "04/30/2020",
        "PricingTarget": {  },
        "PricingStrategy": {  },
        "InternalNote": "This is my note."
    }
]
```

First determine what type of Pricing Target you are going to use, either Customer or Customer Price Type.


**PricingTarget for a Customer:**

```json
{
    "CustomerKey": "12345",
    "CustomerBaseBranchCode": "15"
}
```


**PricingTarget for a CustomerPriceType:**

```json
{
    "CustomerPriceType": "234abc"
}
```

Then you need to determine which Strategy you are going to use, Cost Matrix Code, Velocity Code, or Part Criteria.


**PricingStrategy for Cost Matrix Code:**

```json
{
    "CostMatrixCode": "25abc"
}
```


**PricingStrategy for Velocity Code:**

```json
{
    "VelocityCode": "01adb"
}
```

For Part Criteria you have a few more choices to make, the Price Info and the Part Criteria to which it should apply.
  
You will need to determine which PriceInfo you are going to specify for this record, Contract Price, Parts Price Level, or Service Price Level.

Also, the PartCriteria does NOT have to be fully populated, this is as restrictive as needed to establish the scenario(s) this pricing record should cover.


**PricingStrategy for Part Criteria:**

```json
{
    "PriceData": {
        "ServiceUsesPartsPricing": "false",
        "PriceInfo": {}
    },
    "PartCriteria": {
        "Suppliers": [  //Only Supplier OR PriceGroup can be used not both
            {
                "SupplierCode": "bc23"
            }
        ],
        "PriceGroups": [ //Only Supplier OR PriceGroup can be used not both
            {
                "PriceGroup": "87asdf"
            }
        ],
        "PartType": "part",
        "StockClass": "123abc",
        "Code1": "456def",
        "Code2": "ghj789",
        "PartNumber": "3nva34"  //If PartNumber is used then at least one Supplier is required
    }
}
```


**PriceInfo for Contract Price:**

```json
{
    "Price": "1.00"
}
```


**PriceInfo for Parts Price Level**

```json
{
    "PartsLevel": "Price 1",
    "Multiplier": "1.5"
}
```


**PriceInfo for Service Level**

```json
{
    "ServiceLevel": "Price 1",
    "Multiplier": "1.5"
}
```


**Pricing Target is Customer, Pricing Strategy is Velocity Code example:**

```json
[
    {
        "ExpirationDate": "04/30/2020",
        "PricingTarget": {
            "CustomerKey": "12345",
            "CustomerBaseBranchCode": "15"
        },
        "PricingStrategy": {
            "VelocityCode": "01adb"
        },
        "InternalNote": "This is my note."
    }
]
```


**Pricing Target is Customer Price Type, Pricing Strategy is Velocity Code example:**

```json
[
    {
        "ExpirationDate": "04/30/2020",
        "PricingTarget": {
            "CustomerPriceType": "234abc"
        },
        "PricingStrategy": {
            "VelocityCode": "01adb"
        },
        "InternalNote": "This is my note."
    }
]
```
