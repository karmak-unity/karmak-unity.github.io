The Branches API allows users to Get and Update Branch records in Fusion

## Overview

The Branches API in Karmak Unity will allow 3rd Parties to Get and Update information about Branches setup in the Fusion Business System.

### GET

```
https://api.karmak.io/api/unity/{version}/unityapi/Branch/{branchcode}
```

### PUT

```
https://api.karmak.io/api/unity/{version}/unityapi/Branch/Update
```

### Specifications

#### GET

* The Branch Code must be passed in as part of the URL to get information about a specific Branch.  
* The GET returns the same information that can be included in the PUT Request.  


#### PUT

* The PUT method will be used to update Branch Records in Fusion.
* Only one Branch record will be allowed in a single request call.
* Only fields that are expected to be updated should be passed in outside of the required fields.
* In order to update an existing Branch record the user will be required to send in the Branch Identity section of the request to find an existing Branch. If an existing Branch is not found no update will be performed.
* A response will be provided with a message section that will outline a success or any issues that prevented the Branch from being updated.
* The Fusion Username used in the Unity API call will be used as the Last Update User of the Branch created.
* The Date and Time the Unity API call was made will be used as the Last Update of the Branch created.
