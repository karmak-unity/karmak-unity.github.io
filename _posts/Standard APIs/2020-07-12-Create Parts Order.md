description:  Create a parts order within Fusion and return an Order Number
---


The Part Order API is used to create a Parts Sales Order.

When placing an order the parts and quantities passed to the API are processed as an order on the business system and, if successful, the order number is returned.


***NOTE: Requires Fusion version 3.60.10***

**Validations for Part Order**

- For customer with “On Hold” status in the business system, the order will be placed only if the “Allow order if On-Hold/Over Credit Limit?” flag is set to “Yes” for the customer in the Admin web site. Customer status is controlled by the business system.

#### Valid Order Status values
```json
{
	"In Process",
    "Quote"
}
 ```
 
**OrderStatus Notations:**

•	An “In Process” status means when you add a part onto a Parts Order it will remove the Quantity from On Hand and it will go to a Committed Status where it will sit until you invoice it.

•	A “Quote” won't remove quantity from the Available and by default it sets the Action Type of the Part to Force Fill and doesn't let that be changed until you turn the Quote into an Open Order in Fusion.



**Note for Misc charges**
The Misc charges array is required. if you do not have any misc charges, submit the following: 
```
	"miscCharges": [],
```
