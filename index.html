<h2>Optimizing partner integrations – adding value to customers</h2>

<p>With the heavy-duty industry becoming more and more reliant on software platforms to perform key business functions, the need to coordinate and optimize those systems has become even more evident.  That’s why we’ve put focus on developing and optimizing the way Karmak, our partners, and our clients interact with data – allowing all parties to operate at the speed of business.</p>
<p>As an experienced leader in the DMS space, Karmak has continued to grow our partnership network to benefit our Fusion clients, with their customers in mind.  Now, to make it even easier for partners (and clients) to create data integrations with Fusion, we have developed a pre-defined API framework called Unity. </p>

			<h2>NEW API Management Portal</h2>
			<h4>October 25,2021</h5>
			<h5> Karmak has released a new API Portal with a new Management system and interactive Portal capabilities. If you are new to Unity and Karmak APIs, please head to <a href="https://portal.kamak.io">portal.karmak.io</a>.</h5>

<h2>What is Unity?</h2>
Unity is an API catalog for partners and developers to find, connect, and manage their API connections to Karmak Dealership Management Solutions. Find the APIs that you need for your project, embed the API into your applications creating a more seamless experience for our customers.

<p>Unity also provides read-only access to Fusion – allowing both partners and customers to query data as the need arises.</p>

<p><strong>How it helps:</strong>
<ul>
   <li> Flexibility – align data integration to meet your business needs
   <li> Effectiveness – streamline workflows, better share and leverage data
   <li> Efficiency – focus resources more strategically, save time and money
   </ul>
</p>
<h3>For App Developers</h3>
It's really easy to use Unity to start consuming APIs. With Unity, you can consume any API using a unified REST or SOAP format that is easy to understand and embed in your app.
