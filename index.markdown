# Karmak Unity
## What is Unity?
Unity is an API catalog for partners and developers to find, connect, and manage their API connections to Karmak Dealership Managment Solutions. Find the APIs that you need for your project, embed the API into your app, and track usage of all your APIs through a single dashboard

## For App Developers
It's really easy to use Unity to start consuming APIs. With Unity, you can consume any API using a unified REST or SOAP format that is easy to understand and embed in your app.
